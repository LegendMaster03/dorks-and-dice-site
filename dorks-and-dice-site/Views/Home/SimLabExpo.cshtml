<h1 class="mb-3">Weed Wacker (S.I.M. Lab Expo Prototype)</h1>
<p>
    Student worker contribution at Florida Polytechnic University's S.I.M. Lab.
    Work included media production support, motion capture support, and building a game demo for the Fall 2022 Game Expo.
</p>
<p>
    This was a time-boxed expo deliverable built under a short deadline. The objective was to produce a functional
    demonstration for event use, and I prioritized completion, stability, and showcasing the core motion-capture workflow.
