    During my time as a student worker for the S.I.M Lab (Simulation Instruction and Multimedia Lab) at
    Florida Polytechnic University, I helped students with all forms of media production such as game development,
    film, sound design, and motion capture. I also helped manage the inventory and equipment of the lab.
    I also made a game demonstrating motion capture and Unity game development for the Florida Polytechnic 2022
    Fall Game Expo.
