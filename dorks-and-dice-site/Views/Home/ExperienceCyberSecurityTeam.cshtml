    <h2 class="h5">Directed Independent Study (UNF Cyber Team Performance)</h2>
    <p>
        During my last semester, I shifted from competition participation to a directed independent study under
        Professor J. Scott Kelly. The study focused on why our team underperforms, why other schools perform better,
        and what process changes are needed to improve outcomes.
