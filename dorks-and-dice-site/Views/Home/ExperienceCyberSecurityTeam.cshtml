    <h2 class="h5">Directed Independent Study (UNF Cyber Team Performance)</h2>
    <p>
        During my last semester, I shifted from competition participation to a directed independent study under
        Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jscottkelly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J. Scott Kelly</a>.
        The study focused on why our team underperforms, why peer schools perform better,
        and what process changes are needed to improve outcomes.
